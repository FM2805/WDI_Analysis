# Overview

In this repository, we analyse information from the World Development Indicator (WDI) database, which is maintained by the World Bank.
We use different methods such as linear regression, non-linear models, logistic regression and cluster analysis. We use the output of step 1 (see below) in steps 2 and 3.

There are three scripts:

1. DownloadAndPrepare: Access the data through the an API and prepare it for the analysis

2. RegressionAnalysis: Conduct an analysis with regression methods

3. ClusterAnalysis: Implement cluster analysis.
